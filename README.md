# DayPlanner
This is an application that helps the user to plan their activities for the day.
It allows the user to make entries indicating what activities they will be doing during each hour of a regular business day.
The user can enter and save activities in the app.
jQuery was used to manipulate the DOM to assign color codes to various hours of the day depending on if it is in the past, present or future.
jQuery also powers the app to save and retrieve entries made by the user.
The app is linked to the bootstrap library to add styles and make it responsive; it is also linked to the moment.js library to record the current time and date.
The app can be accessed at the following link: https://cornelli85.github.io/DayPlanner/.
The Github repo can be accessed here: https://github.com/cornelli85/DayPlanner.
